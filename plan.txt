Pyramid
    - each person in row splits the weight of the person above them

    - "Distributed weight" = person's weight + weight they are supporting above them
        > Ex: Person A's weight is split between persons B and C
        > Ex: Person E
            - directly supporting half of B (100 lbs)
            - half the weight of person E (100 lbs)
            - half the weight person b is shouldering (50 lbs)
            - half the weight person c is shouldering (50 lbs)
                = supporting 300 lbs
        > Ex: Person D
            - Only weight on them comes from person B
            - Half of person B (100 lbs)
            - Half the weight person B is holding (50 lbs)
                = Total 150 lbs
        > Ex: Person H
            - half of person D (100 lbs)
            - half of Person E (100 lbs)
            - half the weight D is holding (75 lbs)
            - half the weight E is holding (150 lbs)
                = Total 425 lbs


    - Each person weighs 200 lbs
